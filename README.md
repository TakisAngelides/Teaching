# Teaching Python

Course Name: Scientific Computing with Python

These are the code files used for the 21-lesson series I have organised and I taught at a local high school to a group of 10 students.

Some of the first lessons include exercises with solutions. 

Physics simulations include: gravitational orbits, pendulum, electric field from static charges, rocket simulation and more.

Mathematical methods include: hit or miss monte carlo integration, fitting functions and more.

Computer Science concepts include: cellular automata and conways game of life, backtracking, dfs, graph theory.
